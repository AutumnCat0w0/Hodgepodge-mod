# Hodgepodge-mod
There are more than 50 countries, most of which are overhead countries, or refer to some anime works (SAO, OVERLOAD), adding 7 new natural wonders (Ayafara volcano, the eye of the Sahara, Mount Everest, etc.), and three resources (tea, jade, etc.).
Â·Hodgepodge-mod 
This is an unciv mod written to allow my friends to play the civilization they want in the game.
Most of the newly added civilizations in mod will control their strength and strive to maintain a similar level of strength to the original version. Even using the original civilization does not necessarily mean that it will be weaker than mod civilization.

Meanwhile, I have created 7 new natural wonders so far, namely:Eyjafjallajokull,Eye of the Sahara,Devils Tower,Crater lake,Yggdrasil,Atlantis
Luxury resources such as tea and jade have been added,as for rice... although I have also joined as a reward resource, I am a bit tempted to remove it

I am a mod author from China, so there may be some partially translated Chinese characters in mod, and I will translate them later.
